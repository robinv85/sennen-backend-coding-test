# Coding exercise

Write a small example in nodejs.

There is no right or wrong answer here and do as much or as little as you like -just wanting to get a feel for coding style and ability.
Think clean, tidy, well-structured code over features / functionality.

Structure and arrange as you wishâ€“keep it simple and understandable.

## Basic example:
* Using https://sunrise-sunset.org/api, fetch the sunrise / sunset times
* Generate a list of 100 random lat / long points around the world
* Fetch sunrise/sunset times for all points, but never run more than 5 in parallel
* Find earliest sunrise and list the day length for this time

Consider:
* Well named, readable code
* Think about what might be extended or changed in future.
* Use ramda if you wish, implement some functional programming techniques
* Handle errors properly*Use typescript if you are familiar with it

Please submit your test in the form of a link to a public git repository (github / bitbucket etc)
